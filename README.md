# Pipelined_RISC-V_CV30E40P_UVM_Verification

This repository has documents, references and UVM verification code for Pipelined RISC-V  core CV32E40P. A core which is an open-source 32-bit RISC-V processor core designed for embedded systems, featuring a 5-stage pipeline and integrated memory interfaces for efficient instruction fetch and data access.    

## Specs
It supports the RV32IM instruction set architecture.\  
Includes several custom extensions, such as hardware loops, post-increment load/store instructions, enhanced ALU operations, and SIMDÂ instructions.

For RV32I ISA, there are four core instruction formats (R/I/S/B/U/J), as shown in Figure.\
All are a fixed 32 bits in length and must be aligned on a four-byte boundary in memory.

The complete information and details of the core CV32E40P for all details about instruction formats and extentions are exist in these documents [RISCV_CARD](/docs/RISCV_CARD.pdf) [riscv-spec](/docs/riscv-spec-20191213_0.pdf)

Also, for custom extensions and more details about the core and its implementation, this databook is very importan [databook](/Databook/)     


## interfaces   

The OBI protocol that is used by the instruction fetch and LSU as shown in the below figure. But, we should take in our consideration that The CV32E40P instruction fetch interface does not implement the following optional OBI signals: we, be, wdata, auser, wuser, aid, rready, err, ruser, rid and The CV32E40P data interface does not implement the following optional OBI signals: auser, wuser, aid, rready, err, ruser, rid.
