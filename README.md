# Pipelined_RISC-V_CV30E40P_UVM_Verification
This repository has documents, references and UVM verification code for Pipelined RISC-V  core CV32E40P. A core which is an open-source 32-bit RISC-V processor core designed for embedded systems, featuring a 5-stage pipeline and integrated memory interfaces for efficient instruction fetch and data access.

It supports the RV32IM instruction set architecture.\
Includes several custom extensions, such as hardware loops, post-increment load/store instructions, enhanced ALU operations, and SIMDÂ instructions.
